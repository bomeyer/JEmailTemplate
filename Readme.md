Overrides JMail to embedd E-Mail body into header and footer. Works on every E-Mail that
is send through JMail (user registration, personal mail etc.). Activates HTML in all
outgoing E-Mails (be aware of that, you will have to override all standard E-Mails texts 
to include line-breaks ('<br/>') instead of only new-lines ('\n').

Install the plugin, activate it and set the images and texts in the plugin's option tab.
Images will be fetched from your homepage, so the server must be publicly available for
the images to appear in the sent E-Mails.

Only tested with Joomla 3.2
